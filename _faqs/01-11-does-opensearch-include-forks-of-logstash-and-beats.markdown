question: Does OpenSearch include forks of Logstash and Beats?
---

No. There is [documentation](https://docs-beta.opensearch.org/docs/agents-and-ingestion-tools/#compatibility-matrices) 
on which versions of Logstash and Beats work with OpenSearch. We will be providing, more documentation on how to use them with OpenSearch
and download links to OpenSearch compatible versions.
